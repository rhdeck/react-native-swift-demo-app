# react-native-swift-demo-app

I was going to post the react native project for this, but it's actually pretty simple.

```
react-native init [projectname]
cd [projectname]
Copy the App.js from this repository into your project directory. 
npm install --save rhdeck/react-native-swift-demo-module
npm install --save react-native-swift
npm install 
react-native link
```
Done! To Test:
```
react-native run-ios
```
Get a Hell Yeah! 

Check out the debugger for the console log output of the sample module doing its thing.
