# react-native-swift-demo-app

I was going to post the react native project for this, but it's actually pretty simple.

1. react-native init [projectname]
2. cd [projectname]
3. Copy the App.js from this repository into your project directory. 
3. npm install --save https://github.com/rhdeck/react-native-swift-demo-module
4. npm install --save react-native-swift
5. npm install 
6. react-native link

Done! To Test:
1. react-native run-ios
2. Get a Hell Yeah! 
3. Check out the debugger for the console log output of the sample module doing its thing.
